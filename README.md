# project MAXI score tracking 

The aim of this project is to produce a fully working front end interface with fully capable score tracking for player of the [DJ MAX RESPECT V game ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/960170/DJMAX_RESPECT_V/)

At the current moment, there is no API/frontend service that allows players to view their own scores without having to log into the game itself. Moreover, there is no concept of a rivalling system that allows players to compare their scores with other players on a platform either. There is complete potential for DJ MAX RESPECT V to implement its own rivalling system however as of season 1 (2021), there has been no announcement of such a system being developed.
